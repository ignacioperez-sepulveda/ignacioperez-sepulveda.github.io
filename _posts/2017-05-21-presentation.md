Hi there,  
Firts of all, Thank you so much for stop by in my technical blog.
The main motivation of my blog is to document some topics research and examples that I do for learn.
But also, I want to share all this information with anyone who want to know about it too.
I really hope that all the information and examples fulfil your needs.


I will focus in subjects such as Speech and Text Processing using Python as a main language for the examples and solutions.
I also will try to talk about some Machine Learning and Deep Learning technics.
