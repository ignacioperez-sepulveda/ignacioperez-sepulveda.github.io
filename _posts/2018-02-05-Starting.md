Hi there,

This is my first official post in my blog. Exciting, isnâ€™t?
Ok, today I just wanted to introduce myself.

I am from Chile and  studied informatics engineering back in 1998 at 
the Universidad Diego Portales.
After that I worked as a business intelligence analyst for 11 years. 
Then I came to Sheffield in order to do my MSc, after that I back to 
Chile and work for two more years until now where I am happily in 
Sheffield starting my PhD research. 

My MSc program was a great refresh for my knowledge and, 
as I expected, was a great personal experience. 
It was here in Sheffield, during my MSc, where i first knew 
about Speech Recognition, the topic that I am very interested.

I took the speech processing and speech recognition modules, 
both dictated by the professors, 
[Roger Moore](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~roger/){:target="_blank"} and 
[Thomas Hain](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~th/){:target="_blank"}.  
My supervisor [Dr. Jon Barker](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/J.Barker/){:target="_blank"} 
was a great inspiration and he encourage me to follow 
what I though would be a good Dissertation Topic, Speech Recognition in Music.
Off course, I can't left but recognize to [Erfan Loweimi](http://mini.dcs.shef.ac.uk/staffs/erfan-loweimi/){:target="_blank"}
who supported and helped me all the time. 

This is all for now, in a future post I can talk more in detail 
about my MSc Dissertation which I think that will be 
very interested for you.

Thank you so much.
